                "description": "Tyrese Gibson joins Shannon Sharpe in this episode of Club Shay Shay for an unfiltered and insightful conversation that dives deep into his life, career, and the experiences that have shaped him.\n\nThe episode starts on a playful note as Tyrese humorously tells Shannon he needs to moisturize, setting the tone for a lively discussion. The two reminisce over a glass of Coca-Cola, with Tyrese sharing the story behind his iconic Coke commercial\u2014a defining moment that skyrocketed his career. He reveals how he arrived late to the audition but still managed to land the role, earning his first $100 and feeling like it was Christmas every day since.\n\nThe conversation takes a deeper turn as Tyrese discusses his challenging childhood, being the youngest of four children and the only one not born in St. Louis. He shares how his family moved to LA for his father\u2019s singing career, only for his father to leave when Tyrese was just seven years old. He opens up about his mother\u2019s struggles with alcoholism and her belief that he was special from birth.\n\nIn discussing his film career, Tyrese talks about his latest movie 1992, a project that faced significant hurdles in Hollywood. He shares how Snoop Dogg, the film\u2019s executive producer, played a pivotal role in generating buzz for the movie. Tyrese praises Snoop as a genius who has reinvented himself time and time again, noting that Snoop\u2019s influence is unmatched\u2014even more so than Jay-Z\u2019s. He also mentions how actors like Denzel Washington and Viola Davis continually reinvent themselves, and how working with Denzel is a dream he has yet to fulfill, as Denzel is the very reason he pursued acting.\n\nTyrese and Shannon also discuss having haters from your own neighborhood like Nipsey Hussle. Then the focus shifts to the power of social media, with Tyrese noting that it has made lying more popular while highlighting that Denzel Washington avoids rumors by staying off social platforms. He humorously recalls the internet clapping back at Shannon for his tote bag and his infamous \u201ctwo-hour-old\u201d Air Force 1s, showcasing Tyrese\u2019s sharp wit and playful nature.\n\nThe conversation touches on Katt Williams\u2019 memorable appearance on Club Shay Shay, with Tyrese calling him \u201cProphet Williams\u201d and discussing the impact of Katt\u2019s truth-telling, even when it\u2019s uncomfortable. Tyrese talks about his ongoing joke with Akon and Ludacris about being dark-skinned and how communities like Jewish, Latino, and Asian people are more unified, though Black culture remains the most influential.\n\nTyrese delves into the complexities of relationships, marriage, and the differences between men and women\u2019s expectations, themes that are also explored in his latest album. He speaks about the importance of genuine friendships, especially in environments like Watts, and how the loyalty of his friends kept him on the right path.\n\nFinally, Tyrese reflects on the role of hardship in shaping his identity, asserting that he has no regrets because every struggle has sculpted him into the man he is today. He recounts his mother's scheme to pretend he had special needs for more government money and shares his thoughts on fame, privacy, and his refusal to let negative experiences define him.\n\nThis episode is a masterclass in resilience, humor, and the art of storytelling, as Tyrese Gibson opens up like never before, providing listeners with a raw and inspiring look into his life and career.\n\n#ClubShayShay\u200b #tyresegibson #shannonsharpe\n\nBuy LePortier: https://leportiercognac.com/products/shay_vsop_750ml/\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest Club Shay Shay content: https://www.youtube.com/c/ClubShayShay?sub_confirmation=1\nListen to the Club Shay Shay podcast on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/club-shay-shay/id1531023690\nListen to the Club Shay Shay podcast on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/060hDdnydsJyMi17TmvyAh?si=iuda1z7oTE-21ZYzwiUdhg&nd=1\n\nLike Club Shay Shay on Facebook: https://m.facebook.com/ClubShayShay/\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Twitter: https://x.com/clubshayshay?s=21&t=PF1soCgsTT_NEerDJm9Lfg\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Instagram: https://instagram.com/clubshayshay?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\nFollow Shannon Sharpe on Twitter: https://x.com/shannonsharpe?s=21&t=PF1soCgsTT_NEerDJm9Lfg\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@clubshayshaypod?_t=8fJ79WZy2fb&_r=1\n\nAbout Club Shay Shay:\nClub Shay Shay is a weekly podcast hosted by Shannon Sharpe \u2013 3x Super Bowl champion, member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and co-host of First Take on ESPN.

Handicaps will not be in effect and no strokes will be given to any player. Each foursome will play holes 10 through 17. After these eight holes, the four lowest-scoring players will compete in a one-hole playoff. In the event that there are ties for the lowest four scores, a chip-off will happen on No. 17 to determine the final four. The player closest to the hole would advance to the final playoff hole.\n\nParticipants:\n\nMac Boucher @MacBoucherGolf \nWesley Bryan  @BryanBrosGolf \nGeorge Bryan  @BryanBrosGolf \nAimee Cho  @GolfWithAimee \nGarrett Clark  @GoodGood \nBrad Dalke  @GoodGood \nPeter Finch  @peterfinchgolf \nGabby GolfGirl  @gabbygolfgirl \nLuke Kwon  @LukeKwonGolf \nMicah Morris @Micahmorrisgolf \nMason Nutt  @BustaJackGolf \nFat Perez  @Bobdoessports \nPaige Spiranac @PaigeSpiranac \nRoger Steele @roger_steele\nTyler Toney @dudeperfect  \nSean Walsh @GoodGood \n\nWelcome to the official YouTube channel of the PGA TOUR.

                "title": "Jurassic World Rebirth",
                "description": "A new era is born.\n\nNext summer, three years after the Jurassic World trilogy concluded with each film surpassing $1 billion at the global box office, the enduring Jurassic series evolves in an ingenious new direction with Jurassic World Rebirth. \n\nAnchored by iconic action superstar Scarlett Johansson, breakthrough talent Jonathan Bailey and two-time Oscar\u00ae winner Mahershala Ali, this action-packed new chapter sees an intrepid team racing to secure DNA samples from the three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air. Also starring acclaimed international stars Rupert Friend and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, the film is directed by dynamic visualist Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) from a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp. \n\nFive years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion, the planet\u2019s ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures within that tropical biosphere hold the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind.\n\nAcademy Award\u00ae nominee Johansson plays skilled covert operations expert Zora Bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure genetic material from the world\u2019s three most massive dinosaurs. When Zora\u2019s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded on an island where they come face-to-face with a sinister, shocking discovery that\u2019s been hidden from the world for decades. \n\nAli is Duncan Kincaid, Zora\u2019s most trusted team leader; Emmy nominee and Olivier Award winner Jonathan Bailey (Wicked, Bridgerton) plays paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis; Emmy nominee Rupert Friend (Homeland, Obi-Wan Kenobi) appears as Big Pharma representative Martin Krebs and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo (The Lincoln Lawyer, Murder on the Orient Express) plays Reuben Delgado, the father of the shipwrecked civilian family. \n\nThe cast includes Luna Blaise (Manifest), David Iacono (The Summer I Turned Pretty) and Audrina Miranda (Lopez vs. Lopez) as Reuben\u2019s family. The film also features, as members of Zora and Krebs\u2019 crews, Philippine Velge (Station Eleven), Bechir Sylvain (BMF) and Ed Skrein (Deadpool). \n \nJurassic World Rebirth is directed by BAFTA winner Edwards from a script by Koepp (War of the Worlds), based on characters created by Michael Crichton. The film is produced by Oscar\u00ae nominee Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, both longtime Jurassic franchise producers and of this summer\u2019s blockbuster, Twisters. The film is executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Denis L. Stewart and Jim Spencer.",

                    "title": "Jurassic World Rebirth",
                    "description": "A new era is born.\n\nNext summer, three years after the Jurassic World trilogy concluded with each film surpassing $1 billion at the global box office, the enduring Jurassic series evolves in an ingenious new direction with Jurassic World Rebirth. \n\nAnchored by iconic action superstar Scarlett Johansson, breakthrough talent Jonathan Bailey and two-time Oscar\u00ae winner Mahershala Ali, this action-packed new chapter sees an intrepid team racing to secure DNA samples from the three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air. Also starring acclaimed international stars Rupert Friend and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, the film is directed by dynamic visualist Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) from a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp. \n\nFive years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion, the planet\u2019s ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures within that tropical biosphere hold the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind.\n\nAcademy Award\u00ae nominee Johansson plays skilled covert operations expert Zora Bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure genetic material from the world\u2019s three most massive dinosaurs. When Zora\u2019s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded on an island where they come face-to-face with a sinister, shocking discovery that\u2019s been hidden from the world for decades. \n\nAli is Duncan Kincaid, Zora\u2019s most trusted team leader; Emmy nominee and Olivier Award winner Jonathan Bailey (Wicked, Bridgerton) plays paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis; Emmy nominee Rupert Friend (Homeland, Obi-Wan Kenobi) appears as Big Pharma representative Martin Krebs and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo (The Lincoln Lawyer, Murder on the Orient Express) plays Reuben Delgado, the father of the shipwrecked civilian family. \n\nThe cast includes Luna Blaise (Manifest), David Iacono (The Summer I Turned Pretty) and Audrina Miranda (Lopez vs. Lopez) as Reuben\u2019s family. The film also features, as members of Zora and Krebs\u2019 crews, Philippine Velge (Station Eleven), Bechir Sylvain (BMF) and Ed Skrein (Deadpool). \n \nJurassic World Rebirth is directed by BAFTA winner Edwards from a script by Koepp (War of the Worlds), based on characters created by Michael Crichton. The film is produced by Oscar\u00ae nominee Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, both longtime Jurassic franchise producers and of this summer\u2019s blockbuster, Twisters. The film is executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Denis L. Stewart and Jim Spencer."

my mind\nWell I saw him walk in\nWith his cowboy hat\nAnd I thought to myself\nI could use some of that\nHis boots like glass on a saw dust floor\nHad moves like nothin\u2019 I\u2019d ever seen before\nSo I walked right up\nI pulled him to the side\nI handed him a beer and looked him right in the eye\nAnd I said \u201cBaby, I think you\u2019re gonna wanna hear this\u201d\nI said\n\nExcuse me,\nYou look like you love me\nYou look like you want me\nTo want you to come on home\nAnd baby I don\u2019t blame you\nFor lookin\u2019 me up and down across this room\nI\u2019m drunk and I\u2019m ready to leave\nAnd you look like you love me\n\nWell I was down at the local beer joint with a few of the guys \nWhen this cute little country girl caught my eye \nAnd boy let me tell you she was the prettiest thing i\u2019d ever seen in a pair of boots\nWell she walked right up to me, handed me a beer \nGave me a look like, lets get outta here \nAnd that's when I realized that she was every cowboys dream come true \nShe told me this right here, she said..\n\nExcuse me,\nYou look like you love me\nYou look like you want me\nTo want you to come on home\nAnd baby I don\u2019t blame you\nFor lookin\u2019 me up and down across this room\nI\u2019m drunk and I\u2019m ready to leave\nAnd you look like you love me\nSo if you ever see a man in a cowboy hat\n\nAnd you think to yourself\nI could use some of that\nDon\u2019t waste your time\nJust give \u2018em this here line\nGoes a little like this\nExcuse me,\nYou look like you love me\nYou look like you want me\nTo want you to come on

The Walten Files, loosely inspired by FNaF, tells the story of a Chuck E. Cheese style children's restaurant and their unsettling possessed mascot animatronics, and it's all told through this creepy found footage 2D animation. \n\nWe didn't know much about The Walten Files before we started this project but we're SO glad we found it. A few months ago, we got a call from The Make-A-Wish foundation. A 12 year old boy named Loren wanted a full sized Bon animatronic, and after having made a bunch of Poppy Playtime and Five Nights at Freddy's animatronics, we jumped at the opportunity!\n\nOur animatronic Bon the Rabbit has a sturdy welded steel frame and is animated with a wiper motor for the waist, and servos for the head and jaw. Standing over 6' tall, he turned out super intimidating. We even worked with Martin Walls, the creator of the Walten Files for a big surprise for Loren.\n\nWe love how our real life Bon turned out and we really hope Loren likes it too!
